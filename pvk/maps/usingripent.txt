To use ripent, simply create a shortcut on your 
desktop to the exe.

Next, right click on the shortcut icon, 
and in the path field add a -export mapname.

Run the shortcut, and ripent will create the 
entity file in the maps folder of the map 
that map.

Edit the .ent file in notepad, then save it.

Change -export in the shortcut to -import.

Run the shortcut, and the map will be updated.

Ripent cannot be used to modify brushwork, 
only entity properties. You can add point-based 
entities, as long as you know the x y z coordinates 
of where you want them added.
