Destroy the enemy's Icon and Bridge while
defending your own.  When only one team has
anything remaining, they will win the round.
The Icon is located in plain view in each 
team's grand hall.  Each team's Bridge is 
being held up by a support, destroy the 
support and the bridge will fall.  Melee
weapons are much more effective than missle
weapons.
