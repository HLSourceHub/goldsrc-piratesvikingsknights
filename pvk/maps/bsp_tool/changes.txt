Stuff changed in bsp_view:
-Fixed many bugs with the skybox textures:
 (skyboxes are drawn right-side-up now.)
 (skyboxes don't show the seam at the edges anymore.)
 (skyboxes are drawn in the same front/back/left/right order as in Half-Life.)
-Replaced $mapdir and $pakdir with $halflife_dir .cfg file item.
 (MOD will be automatically determined based on where the BSP file is found.)
-Added $models item to .cfg file to allow studio models to be rendered.
 (The user can replace the models/filename.mdl with whatever model they wish.)
-Added the $movement_speed and $mouse_sensitivity items to .cfg file.
-Added the ability to show the edges of textures ($show_edges in .cfg file).
-Movement speed is based on frame rate for a more constant speed.
-Modified the TraceLine display to show the start and end (with line between).
-Brush models with renderamt specified will be rendered correctly now.
 (This is mostly used for glass and other transparent brush entities).
