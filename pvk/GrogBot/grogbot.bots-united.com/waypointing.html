GrogBot Waypointing Tutorial
Written by Akz
---

1. What are waypoints for?
--------------------------

GrogBot is using waypoints to navigate through the map. Waypoint is a
location in the map, which the bot will use when navigating. When 
editing waypoints, you can see the waypoints drawn with a green
beam. Some special waypoints (waypoints with flags) are displayed in
other colors. Waypoints will be saved as a mapname.gwp to your GrogBot
waypoints folder (GrogBot\waypoints) waypoint paths will be saved as
mapname.gw1, mapname.gw2, mapname.gw3 and mapname.gw4. The number is 
marking the team. The path files aren't necessary. They will be 
calculated automatically when the waypoints get loaded if they are
not present.

2. Waypointing console commands
-------------------------------

Before we can start to do anything, you need to know these commands:

waypoint on - show the waypoints (displays them with a colored beam)
waypoint off - hide the waypoints
waypoint add - add a waypoint
waypoint delete - delete a waypoint

waypoint radius - shows the waypoint's radius
waypoint radius [new radius] - sets a new radius for this waypoint.

waypoint wait [minimum time] [maximum time] - Sets a waiting time for 
                                              the waypoint.

waypoint addflag - add a special flag (Treasures etc.)

autowaypoint on - automatically adds a waypoint when you walk
autowaypoint off - disable autowaypointing

pathwaypoint on - shows the waypoint paths
pathwaypoint off - hides the waypoint paths

pathwaypoint enable - enables automatic pathwaypointing (default = on)
pathwaypoint disable - disables automatic pathwaypointing

pathwaypoint start - start location for a new path
pathwaypoint end - end location of the new path

pathwaypoint rem_start - remove path start
pathwaypoint rem_end - remove path end

3. How do I make waypoints?
---------------------------

First of all, write these commands in your console:

waypoint on
pathwaypoint on

Now you can see the waypoints and the paths which will be used
to navigate in the map. Well, you don't see anything yet because
we don't have any waypoints placed yet (if there isn't already a
waypoint file for that map). Make two waypoints by writing
"autowaypoint on" to the console. Walk around a bit. Now you can 
see that a path is calculated between these waypoints. If the path 
isn't good, you can remove it with "pathwaypoint rem_start" and
"pathwaypoint rem_end". If you want to add a single waypoint, use
"waypoint add". If you want to end waypointing, remember to use the
"waypoint save" command. Now you know how to place waypoints, do you?
Well, I think you do. Let's continue.

4. Waiting times and radiuses
-----------------------------
You can set a "waiting time" to a waypoint using the "waypoint wait"
command. When a waiting time is set, the bot will eh... wait on the
waypoint for the specified time!

The radiuses are used to set a radius. When the bot is inside that
radius, it will pick a new waypoint to go to. A big radius usually 
causes problems in narrow corridors and such. (Bots getting stuck 
into wall and that sort of probs.)

5. Waypoint flags
-----------------
Sometimes the bots have to pick up a chest, hold a territory, camp, jump 
and so on. You can use a flag to get the bot do those things. We 
can add a flag with "waypoint addflag" command.

When using "waypoint addflag" command, you will see the following
menu.

1. Team Specific
2. Door
3. Camping spot
4. Pirate Base
5. Viking Base
6. Knight Base
7. Jump
8. Rush Waypoint
0. Next Page...

The first one is to make only one team use the current waypoint.

You can use the second one to make bots ignore the walls.

The third one is to make bots camp on this waypoint (only for bowmen).

The bots will drop treasure chests carried by them to their Base 
waypoint. The bots will not pick up any chests near their own base.
If a team has some chests in the beginning of the map, remember
to put a Base waypoint on those chests. That way, the bots will
not pick up their own chests and the other teams will try to get
the chests. If you didn't understand, have a look at my waypoints
for a treasure map (i.e. pvk_island)

Jump waypoint is used to get the bot jump to somewhere.

Rush waypoint is used to get the bot to "rush", the bot doesn't
care so much about enemies if it's on a rush waypoint.

Let's have a look at the next page.

1. Important Wpt
2. Breakable Wpt
3. Pillage Wpt
4. "Use Only If Visible"
5. UOIV Waitpoint
6. Button Wpt
7. Advanced Breakable
0. Cancel

1. Important Waypoint is used in other than treasure maps. (i.e.
territory hold.) The bots will simplytry to get to this waypoint.
When they reach the waypoint, they will pick a new important
waypoint. In territory hold maps, you should place a important
waypoint to the territory area, then add some waiting time and
that's it.

2. Breakable waypoint is used to get the bots to destroy breakable
entities near it.

3. Pillage waypoint is used like the breakable waypoint in pillage
gametype maps, where you need to destroy the func_pillageable
entities to get scored.

4. "Use Only If Visible" (UOIV) waypoint is used to get the bot to
wait until it's possible to get to this waypoint. You need to use
the UOIV Waitpoint in combination with this to get it to work.
Check out pvk_colossus to see an example.

5. Check out the "Use Only If Visible" waypoint description above.

6. The bot will try to use the button near this waypoint.

7. The bots will only destroy the breakables if they are blocking
the way to this waypoint. The "Advanced" breakable waypoint needs 
to be in the place where the bot is trying to go (behind the breakable).
